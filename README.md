# 🍽️ Bistro – Restaurant Management System

### 📘 Overview
**Bistro** is a full-stack Java-based restaurant management system developed as part of the **Software Systems Engineering (61756)** course project.  
It provides a comprehensive digital solution for managing reservations, waiting lists, user memberships, and operational data for a restaurant.

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **client–server system** built in **Java (Eclipse)**, focusing on usability, modularity, and scalability.
